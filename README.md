### Project Title
Bikeshare Dataseet Analysis

### Description
In this project, I designed and implemented a Python-based data analysis pipeline to ingest, process, and analyze bike-share datasets for three major U.S. cities—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
The solution includes robust data loading, transformation, and aggregation logic to compute key descriptive metrics and usage patterns. 
Additionally, I developed an interactive, command-line–driven interface that enables dynamic filtering and on-demand analytics, demonstrating practical data engineering skills in data ingestion, validation, transformation, and user-facing analytics delivery.
